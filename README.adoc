= RISC-V SBI specification

SBI (Supervisor Binary Interface) is an interface between the Supervisor
Execution Environment (SEE) and the supervisor. It allows the supervisor to
execute some privileged operations by using the ecall instruction. Examples of
SEE and supervisor are: M-Mode and S-Mode on Unix-class platforms, where SBI is
the only interface between them, as well as the Hypervisor extended-Supervisor
(HS) and Virtualized Supervisor (VS).

Discussion of SBI occurs on the
https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-unixplatformspec[RISC-V Unix Platform Mailing
list]. It is publicly readable but posting requires being a member of the
RISC-V Foundation. Any new SBI extension needs to be discussed and approved
there before being merged.

https://github.com/riscv/opensbi[OpenSBI] is the reference implementation,
but other implementations exist; see section "SBI Implementation IDs".
