== Performance Monitoring Unit Extension (EID #0x504D55 "PMU")

The RISC-V hardware performance counters such as `mcycle`, `minstret`, and
`mhpmcounterX` CSRs are accessible as read-only from supervisor-mode using
`cycle`, `instret`, and `hpmcounterX` CSRs. The SBI performance monitoring
unit (PMU) extension is an interface for supervisor-mode to configure and
use the RISC-V hardware performance counters with assistance from the
machine-mode (or hypervisor-mode). These hardware performance counters
can only be started, stopped, or configured from machine-mode using
`mcountinhibit` and `mhpmeventX` CSRs. Due to this, a machine-mode SBI
implementation may choose to disallow SBI PMU extension if `mcountinhibit`
CSR is not implemented by the RISC-V platform.

A RISC-V platform generally supports monitoring of various hardware events
using a limited number of hardware performance counters which are up to
64 bits wide. In addition, a SBI implementation can also provide firmware
performance counters which can monitor firmware events such as number of
misaligned load/store instructions, number of RFENCEs, number of IPIs, etc.
All firmware counters must have same number of bits and can be up to 64
bits wide.

The SBI PMU extension provides:

1. An interface for supervisor-mode software to discover and configure
   per-hart hardware/firmware counters
2. A typical https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)[perf] compatible
   interface for hardware/firmware performance counters and events
3. Full access to microarchitecture's raw event encodings

To define SBI PMU extension calls, we first define important entities
`counter_idx`, `event_idx`, and `event_data`. The `counter_idx` is a
logical number assigned to each hardware/firmware counter. The `event_idx`
represents a hardware (or firmware) event whereas the `event_data` is
64 bits wide and represents additional configuration (or parameters) for
a hardware (or firmware) event.

The event_idx is a 20 bits wide number encoded as follows:
[source, C]
----
    event_idx[19:16] = type
    event_idx[15:0] = code
----

=== Event: Hardware general events (Type #0)

The `event_idx.type` (i.e. *event type*) should be `0x0` for all hardware
general events and each hardware general event is identified by an unique
`event_idx.code` (i.e. *event code*) described in the
<<table_pmu_hardware_events>> below.

|===
| General Event Name                 | Code | Description
| SBI_PMU_HW_NO_EVENT                |    0 | Unused event because
                                              `event_idx` cannot be zero
| SBI_PMU_HW_CPU_CYCLES              |    1 | Event for each CPU cycle
| SBI_PMU_HW_INSTRUCTIONS            |    2 | Event for each completed
                                              instruction
| SBI_PMU_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES        |    3 | Event for cache hit

| SBI_PMU_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS     |    5 | Event for a branch instruction
| SBI_PMU_HW_BRANCH_MISSES           |    6 | Event for a branch misprediction
| SBI_PMU_HW_BUS_CYCLES              |    7 | Event for each BUS cycle
| SBI_PMU_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND |    8 | Event for a stalled cycle in
                                              microarchitecture frontend
| SBI_PMU_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_BACKEND  |    9 | Event for a stalled cycle in

                                              CPU cycle
|===

The `event_data` (i.e. *event data*) is unused for hardware general events
and all non-zero values of `event_data` are reserved for future use.

NOTE: A RISC-V platform might halt the CPU clock when it enters WAIT
state using the WFI instruction or enters platform specific SUSPEND state
using the SBI HSM hart suspend call.

NOTE: The *SBI_PMU_HW_CPU_CYCLES* event counts CPU clock cycles as
counted by the `cycle` CSR. These may be variable frequency cycles, and
are not counted when the CPU clock is halted.

NOTE: The *SBI_PMU_HW_REF_CPU_CYCLES* counts fixed-frequency clock
cycles while the CPU clock is not halted. The fixed-frequency of counting
might, for example, be the same frequency at which the `time` CSR counts.

NOTE: The *SBI_PMU_HW_BUS_CYCLES* counts fixed-frequency clock cycles.
The fixed-frequency of counting might be the same frequency at which the
`time` CSR counts, or may be the frequency of the clock at the boundary
between the hart (and it's private caches) and the rest of the system.

=== Event: Hardware cache events (Type #1)

The `event_idx.type` (i.e. *event type*) should be `0x1` for all hardware
cache events and each hardware cache event is identified by an unique
`event_idx.code` (i.e. *event code*) which is encoded as follows:

[source, C]
----
    event_idx.code[15:3] = cache_id
    event_idx.code[2:1] = op_id
    event_idx.code[0:0] = result_id
----

Below tables show possible values of: `event_idx.code.cache_id` (i.e.
*cache event id*), `event_idx.code.op_id` (i.e. *cache operation id*)
and `event_idx.code.result_id` (i.e. *cache result id*).

| SBI_PMU_HW_CACHE_RESULT_MISS   |         1 | Cache miss
|===

The `event_data` (i.e. *event data*) is unused for hardware cache events
and all non-zero values of `event_data` are reserved for future use.

=== Event: Hardware raw events (Type #2)

The `event_idx.type` (i.e. *event type*) should be `0x2` for all hardware
raw events and `event_idx.code` (i.e. *event code*) should be zero.

On RISC-V platform with 32 bits wide `mhpmeventX` CSRs, the `event_data`
configuration (or parameter) should have the 32-bit value to to be programmed
in the `mhpmeventX` CSR.

On RISC-V platform with 64 bits wide `mhpmeventX` CSRs, the `event_data`
configuration (or parameter) should have the 48-bit value to to be programmed
in the lower 48-bits of `mhpmeventX` CSR and the SBI implementation shall
determine the value to be programmed in the upper 16 bits of `mhpmeventX`
CSR.

NOTE: The RISC-V platform hardware implementation may choose to define
the expected value to be written to `mhpmeventX` CSR for a hardware event.
In case of hardware general/cache events, the RISC-V platform hardware
implementation may use the zero-extended `event_idx` as the expected
value for simplicity.

=== Event: Firmware events (Type #15)

The `event_idx.type` (i.e. *event type*) should be `0xf` for all firmware
events and each firmware event is identified by an unique `event_idx.code`
(i.e. *event code*) described in the <<table_pmu_firmware_events>> below.

*Returns* the number of counters (both hardware and firmware) in
`sbiret.value` and always returns `SBI_SUCCESS` in sbiret.error.

=== Function: Get details of a counter (FID #1)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_pmu_counter_get_info(unsigned long counter_idx)
----

Get details about the specified counter such as underlying CSR number,
width of the counter, type of counter hardware/firmware, etc.

The `counter_info` returned by this SBI call is encoded as follows:
[source, C]
----
    counter_info[11:0] = CSR (12bit CSR number)
    counter_info[17:12] = Width (One less than number of bits in CSR)
    counter_info[XLEN-2:18] = Reserved for future use
    counter_info[XLEN-1] = Type (0 = hardware and 1 = firmware)
----

If `counter_info.type == 1` then `counter_info.csr` and `counter_info.width`
should be ignored.

*Returns* the `counter_info` described above in `sbiret.value`.

----

Find and configure a counter from a set of counters which is not started
(or enabled) and can monitor the specified event. The `counter_idx_base`
and `counter_idx_mask` parameters represent the set of counters whereas
`event_idx` represents the event to be monitored and `event_data`
represents any additional event configuration.

The `config_flags` parameter represents additional counter configuration
and filter flags. The bit definitions of the `config_flags` parameter are
shown in the <<table_pmu_counter_cfg_match_flags>> below.

|===

NOTE: When *SBI_PMU_CFG_FLAG_SKIP_MATCH* is set in `config_flags`, the
SBI implementation will unconditionally select the first counter from the
set of counters specified by the `counter_idx_base` and `counter_idx_mask`.

NOTE: The *SBI_PMU_CFG_FLAG_AUTO_START* flag in `config_flags` has no
impact on the counter value.

NOTE: The `config_flags[3:7]` bits are event filtering hints so these
can be ignored or overridden by the SBI implementation for security concerns
or due to lack of event filtering support in the underlying RISC-V platform.

*Returns* the `counter_idx` in `sbiret.value` upon success.

In case of failure, the possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are

|===

NOTE: When SBI_PMU_START_SET_INIT_VALUE is not set in `start_flags`,
the counter value will not be modified and event counting will start
from current counter value.

The shared memory address must be set during boot via
`sbi_pmu_snapshot_set_shmem` before the `SBI_PMU_START_FLAG_INIT_SNAPSHOT`
flag may be used. The SBI implementation must initialize all the given valid
counters (to be started) from the value set in the shared snapshot memory.

NOTE: `SBI_PMU_START_SET_INIT_VALUE` and `SBI_PMU_START_FLAG_INIT_SNAPSHOT` are
mutually exclusive as the former is only valid for a single counter.

The shared memory address must be set during boot via
`sbi_pmu_snapshot_set_shmem` before the `SBI_PMU_STOP_FLAG_TAKE_SNAPSHOT` flag
may be used. The SBI implementation must save the current value of all the
stopped counters in the shared memory if `SBI_PMU_STOP_FLAG_TAKE_SNAPSHOT` is
set. The values corresponding to all other counters must not be modified. The
SBI implementation must additionally update the overflown counter bitmap in the
shared memory.

Provide the current firmware counter value in `sbiret.value`. On RV32 systems,
the `sbiret.value` will only contain the lower 32 bits of the current firmware
counter value.

=== Function: Read a firmware counter high bits (FID #6)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_pmu_counter_fw_read_hi(unsigned long counter_idx)

Provide the upper 32 bits of the current firmware counter value in
`sbiret.value`. This function always returns zero in `sbiret.value`
for RV64 (or higher) systems.

=== Function: Set PMU snapshot shared memory (FID #7)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_pmu_snapshot_set_shmem(unsigned long shmem_phys_lo,
                                         unsigned long shmem_phys_hi,
                                         unsigned long flags)
----

Set and enable the PMU snapshot shared memory.

If both `shmem_phys_lo` and `shmem_phys_hi` parameters are not all-ones
bitwise then `shmem_phys_lo` specifies the lower XLEN bits and `shmem_phys_hi`
specifies the upper XLEN bits of the snapshot shared memory physical base
address. The `shmem_phys_lo` MUST be 4096 bytes (i.e. page) aligned and
the size of the snapshot shared memory must be 4096 bytes. The layout
of the snapshot shared memory is described in <<table_snapshot_shmem_layout>>.

If both `shmem_phys_lo` and `shmem_phys_hi` parameters are all-ones bitwise
then the PMU snapshot shared memory is cleared and disabled.

The `flags` parameter is reserved for future use and must be zero.

This is an optional function and the SBI implementation may choose not to
implement it.

                                              represents the value of each
                                              logical counter associated with
                                              hardware/firmware relative to the

|===

Any future revisions to this structure should be made in a backward compatible
manner and will be associated with an SBI version.

The logical counter indicies in the `counter_overflow_bitmap` and `counter_values`
array are relative w.r.t to `counter_idx_base` argument present in the
`sbi_pmu_counter_stop` and `sbi_pmu_counter_start` functions. This allows the
users to use snapshot feature for more than XLEN counters if required.

This function should be invoked only once per hart at boot time. Once
configured, the SBI implementation has read/write access to the shared memory
when `sbi_pmu_counter_stop` is invoked with the
`SBI_PMU_STOP_FLAG_TAKE_SNAPSHOT` flag set. The SBI implementation has read
only access when `sbi_pmu_counter_start` is invoked with the
`SBI_PMU_START_FLAG_INIT_SNAPSHOT` flag set. The SBI implementation must not
access this memory any other time.
