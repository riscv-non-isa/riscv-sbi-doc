== Supervisor Software Events Extension (EID #0x535345 "SSE")

The SBI Supervisor Software Events (SSE) extension provides a mechanism to
inject software events from an SBI implementation to supervisor software such
that it preempts all other traps and interrupts. The supervisor software will
receive software events only on harts which are ready to receive them. A software
event is delivered only after supervisor software has registered an event handler
and enabled the software event.

The software events can be of two types: local or global. A local software
event is local to a hart and can be handled only on that hart whereas a
global software event is a system event and can be handled by any participating
hart.

=== Software Event Identification

Each software event is identified by a unique 32-bit unsigned integer called
`event_id`. The `event_id` space is divided into multiple 16-bit ranges where
each 16-bit range is encoded as follows:
[source, C]
----
    event_id[14:14] = Platform (0: Standard event, 1: Platform specific event)
    event_id[15:15] = Global (0: Local event, 1: Global event)
----

The <<table_sse_event_ids>> below show the complete `event_id` space along
with standard events based on the above encoding.

=== Software Event States

At any point in time, a software event can be in one of the following states:

. **UNUSED**     - Software event is not used by supervisor software
. **REGISTERED** - Supervisor software has provided an event handler for
                   the software event
. **ENABLED**    - Supervisor software is ready to handle the software event
. **RUNNING**    - Supervisor software is handling the software event

A **global** software event **MUST** be registered and enabled only once by
any hart. By default, a global software event will be routed to any hart which
is ready to receive software events but supervisor software can provide a
preferred hart to handle this software event. The state of a global software
event **MUST** be common to all harts.

NOTE: The preferred hart assigned to a global software event by the
supervisor software is only a hint about supervisor software's preference.
The SBI implementation may choose a different hart for handling the
global software event to avoid an inter-processor interrupt.

A **local** software event **MUST** be registered and enabled by all harts
which want to handle this event. A local event is delivered to a hart only
when the hart is ready to receive software events and the local event is
registered and enabled on that hart. The state of a local software event
**MUST** be tracked separately for each hart.

NOTE: If a software event in `RUNNING` state is signalled by the event source
again, the software event will be taken only after the running event handler
completes, provided that supervisor software doesn't disable the software
event upon completion.

The <<figure_sbi_sse_state_machine>> below shows the state transitions of a
software event.

.SBI SSE State Machine

=== Software Event Priority

Each software event has an associated priority (referred as `event_priority`)
which can be used by an SBI implementation to select a software event for
injection when multiple software events are pending on the same hart.

The priority of a software event is a 32-bit unsigned integer where lower
value means higher priority. By default, all software events have event
priority as zero.

If two or more software events have same priority on a given hart then the
SBI implementation must use `event_id` for tie-breaking where lower `event_id`
has higher priority.

A higher priority software event, unless disabled by supervisor software,
**always** preempts a lower priority software event in `RUNNING` state on
the same hart. Once a higher priority software event is completed, the
previous lower priority software event will be resumed.

=== Software Event Attributes

A software event can have various XLEN bits wide attributes associated to it
where each event attribute is identified by a unique 32-bit unsigned integer
called `attr_id`. A software event attribute can have a Read-Only or Read-Write
access permissions. The <<table_sse_event_attributes>> below provides a list
event attributes.

=== Software Event Injection

To inject a software event on a hart, the SBI implementation must do the
following:

. Save interrupted state of supervisor mode
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS` event attribute as follows:
     ... `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[0:0]` = interrupted `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
     ... `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[1:1]` = interrupted `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit value
     ... if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[2:2]` = interrupted `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit value
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:3]` = interrupted `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit value
     ... else
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:2]` = zero
     ... Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[XLEN-1:4]` = zero
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_SEPC` event attribute = interrupted `sepc` CSR
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_A6` event attribute = interrupted `A6` GPR value
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_A7` event attribute = interrupted `A7` GPR value
. Redirect execution to supervisor event handler
  .. Set `A6` GPR = Current Hart id
  .. Set `A7` GPR = `ENTRY_ARG` event attribute value
  .. Set `sepc` = Interrupted program counter value
  .. Set `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit = interrupted privilege mode
  .. Set `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit = `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit value
  .. Set `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit = zero
  .. if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
     ... Set `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit = interrupted virtualization state
     ... if `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit == 1:
       .... Set `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit = `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
  .. Set virtualization state = OFF
  .. Set privilege mode = S-mode
  .. Set program counter = `ENTRY_PC` event attribute value

=== Software Event Completion

After handling the software event on a hart, the supervisor software must
notify the SBI implementation about completion of event handling using
`sbi_sse_complete` call. The SBI implementation must do the following to
resume the interrupted state for a completed event:

. Set program counter = `sepc` CSR value
. Set privilege mode = `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
. if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
  .. Set virtualization state = `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit value
  .. Set `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[2:2]` event attribute value
  .. Set `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:3]` event attribute value
. Set `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit = `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit
. Set `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[1:1]` event attribute value
. Set `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[0:0]` event attribute value
. Set `A7` GPR = `INTERRUPTED_A7` event attribute value
. Set `A6` GPR = `INTERRUPTED_A6` event attribute value
. Set `sepc` = `INTERRUPTED_SEPC` event attribute value

If the supervisor software wishes to resume from a different location,
it can update the event attributes of the software event before calling
`sbi_sse_complete`.

Complete the supervisor event handling for the highest priority event in
`RUNNING` state on the calling hart.

If there were no events in `RUNNING` state on the calling hart then this
function does nothing and returns `SBI_SUCCESS` otherwise it moves the
highest priority event in `RUNNING` state to `ENABLED` state and resumes
interrupted supervisor state as decribed in <<_software_event_completion>>.

=== Function: Inject a software event (FID #7)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_sse_inject(uint32_t event_id, unsigned long hart_id)
----

The supervisor software can inject a software event with the help of this
function. The `event_id` paramater refers to the event to be injected.

For local events, the `hart_id` parameter refers to the hart on which the
event is to be injected.
For global events, the `hart_id` parameter is ignored.

An event can only be injected if it is allowed by the event attribute as
described in <<table_sse_event_attributes>>.

In case of an error, possible error codes are listed in
<<table_sse_inject_errors>> below.

|===
| Error code              | Description
| SBI_SUCCESS             | Event is successfully injected.
| SBI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED   | `event` is not reserved and valid, but the platform
                            does not support it due to one or more missing
                            dependencies (Hardware or SBI implementation).
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM   | `event_id` or `hart_id` is invalid.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED          | The injection failed for unspecified or unknown other
                            reasons.

=== Function: Unmask software events on a hart (FID #8)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_sse_hart_unmask(void)
----

Start receiving (or unmask) software events on the calling hart. In other
words, the calling hart is ready to receive software events from the SBI
implementation.

The software events are masked initially on all harts so the supervisor
software must explicitly unmask software events on relevant harts at
boot-time.

In case of an error, possible error codes are listed in
<<table_sse_hard_unmask_errors>> below.

| Error code              | Description
| SBI_SUCCESS             | Software events unmasked successfully on the calling hart.
| SBI_ERR_ALREADY_STARTED | Software events were already unmasked on the calling hart.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED          | The request failed for unspecified or unknown other reasons.

=== Function: Mask software events on a hart (FID #9)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_sse_hart_mask(void)
----

Stop receiving (or mask) software events on the calling hart. In other
words, the calling hart is not ready to receive software events from
the SBI implementation.

In case of an error, possible error codes are listed in
<<table_sse_hard_mask_errors>> below.

| SBI_ERR_ALREADY_STOPPED | Software events were already masked on the calling hart.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED          | The request failed for unspecified or unknown other reasons.
