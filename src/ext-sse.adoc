== Supervisor Software Events Extension (EID #0x535345 "SSE")

The SBI Supervisor Software Events (SSE) extension provides a mechanism to
inject software events from an SBI implementation to supervisor software such
that it preempts all other traps and interrupts. The supervisor software will
receive a software event only after it has registered an event handler and
enabled the software event.

The software events can be of two types: local or global. A local software
event is local to a hart and can be handled only on that hart whereas a
global software event is a system event and can be handled by any hart.

=== Software Event Identification

Each software event is identified by a unique 32-bit unsigned integer called
`event_id`. The `event_id` space is divided into multiple 16-bit ranges where
each 16-bit range is encoded as follows:
[source, C]
----
    event_id[14:14] = Platform (0: Standard event, 1: Platform specific event)
    event_id[15:15] = Global (0: Local event, 1: Global event)
----

The <<table_sse_event_ids>> below show the complete `event_id` space along
with standard events based on the above encoding.

=== Software Event States

At any point in time, a software event can be in one of the following states:

. **UNUSED**     - Software event is not used by supervisor software
. **REGISTERED** - Supervisor software has provided an event handler for
                   the software event
. **ENABLED**    - Supervisor software is ready to handle the software event
. **RUNNING**    - Supervisor software is handling the software event

A **global** software event **MUST** be registered and enabled only once by
any hart. By default, a global software event will be routed to any hart but
supervisor software can provide a preferred hart to handle this software event.
The state of a global software event **MUST** be common to all harts.

NOTE: The preferred hart assigned to a global software event by the
supervisor software is only a hint about supervisor software's preference.
The SBI implementation may choose a different hart for handling the
global software event to avoid an inter-processor interrupt.

A **local** software event **MUST** be registered and enabled by all harts
who want to handle the event. The state of a local software event **MUST**
be tracked separately for each hart.

NOTE: If a software event in `RUNNING` state is signalled by the event source
again, the software event will be taken only after the running event handler
completes, provided that supervisor software doesn't disable the software
event upon completion.

The <<figure_sbi_sse_state_machine>> below shows the state transitions of a
software event.

[#figure_sbi_sse_state_machine]
.SBI SSE State Machine
image::images/riscv-sbi-sse-sm.png[]

=== Software Event Priority

Each software event has an associated priority (referred as `event_priority`)
which can be used by an SBI implementation to select a software event for
injection when multiple software events are pending on the same hart.

The priority of a software event is a 32-bit unsigned integer where lower
value means higher priority. By default, all software events have event
priority as zero.

If two or more software events have same priority on a given hart then the
SBI implementation must use `event_id` for tie-breaking where lower `event_id`
has higher priority.

A higher priority software event, unless disabled by supervisor software,
**always** preempts a lower priority software event in `RUNNING` state on
the same hart. Once a higher priority software event is completed, the
previous lower priority software event will be resumed.

=== Software Event Attributes

A software event can have various XLEN bits wide attributes associated to it
where each event attribute is identified by a unique 32-bit unsigned integer
called `attr_id`. A software event attribute can have a Read-Only or Read-Write
access permissions. The <<table_sse_event_attributes>> below provides a list
event attributes.

=== Software Event Injection

To inject a software event on a hart, the SBI implementation must do the
following:

. Save interrupted state of supervisor mode
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS` event attribute as follows:
     ... `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[0:0]` = interrupted `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
     ... `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[1:1]` = interrupted `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit value
     ... if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[2:2]` = interrupted `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit value
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:3]` = interrupted `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit value
     ... else
     ....  Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:2]` = zero
     ... Set `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[XLEN-1:4]` = zero
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_SEPC` event attribute = interrupted `sepc` CSR
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_A6` event attribute = interrupted `A6` GPR value
  .. Set `INTERRUPTED_A7` event attribute = interrupted `A7` GPR value
. Redirect execution to supervisor event handler
  .. Set `A6` GPR = Current Hart id
  .. Set `A7` GPR = `ENTRY_ARG` event attribute value
  .. Set `sepc` = Interrupted program counter value
  .. Set `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit = interrupted privilege mode
  .. Set `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit = `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit value
  .. Set `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit = zero
  .. if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
     ... Set `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit = interrupted virtualization state
     ... if `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit == 1:
       .... Set `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit = `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
  .. Set virtualization state = OFF
  .. Set privilege mode = S-mode
  .. Set program counter = `ENTRY_PC` event attribute value

=== Software Event Completion

After handling the software event on a hart, the supervisor software must
notify the SBI implementation about completion of event handling using
`sbi_sse_complete` call. The SBI implementation must do the following to
resume the interrupted state for a completed event:

. Set program counter = `sepc` CSR value
. Set privilege mode = `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit value
. if H-extension is available to supervisor mode:
  .. Set virtualization state = `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit value
  .. Set `hstatus.SPV` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[2:2]` event attribute value
  .. Set `hstatus.SPVP` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[3:3]` event attribute value
. Set `sstatus.SIE` CSR bit = `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit
. Set `sstatus.SPIE` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[1:1]` event attribute value
. Set `sstatus.SPP` CSR bit = `INTERRUPTED_FLAGS[0:0]` event attribute value
. Set `A7` GPR = `INTERRUPTED_A7` event attribute value
. Set `A6` GPR = `INTERRUPTED_A6` event attribute value
. Set `sepc` = `INTERRUPTED_SEPC` event attribute value

If the supervisor software wishes to resume from a different location,
it can update the event attributes of the software event before calling
`sbi_sse_complete`.

The `event_id` parameter specifies the event ID for which an event handler
is being registered. The `handler_entry_pc` parameter MUST be 2-bytes aligned
