== Steal-time Accounting Extension (EID #0x535441 "STA")

SBI implementations may encounter situations where virtual harts are ready to
run, but must be withheld from running. These situations may be, for example,
when multiple SBI domains share processors or when an SBI implementation is a
hypervisor and guest contexts share processors with other guest contexts or
host tasks. When virtual harts are at times withheld from running, observers
within the contexts of the virtual harts may need a way to account for less
progress than would otherwise be expected. The time a virtual hart was ready,
but had to wait, is called "stolen time" and the tracking of it is referred to
as steal-time accounting. The Steal-time Accounting (STA) extension defines the
mechanism in which an SBI implementation provides steal-time and preemption
information, for each virtual hart, to supervisor-mode software.

=== Function: Set Steal-time Shared Memory Address (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_steal_time_set_shmem(unsigned long shmem_phys_lo,
                                       unsigned long shmem_phys_hi,
                                       unsigned long flags)
----

Set the shared memory physical base address for steal-time accounting of the
calling virtual hart and enable the SBI implementation's steal-time information
reporting.

If `shmem_phys_lo` and `shmem_phys_hi` are not all-ones bitwise, then
`shmem_phys_lo` specifies the lower XLEN bits and `shmem_phys_hi` specifies the
upper XLEN bits of the shared memory physical base address. `shmem_phys_lo`
MUST be 64-byte aligned. The size of the shared memory must be at least 64
bytes. All bytes MUST be set to zero by the SBI implementation before returning
from the SBI call.

If `shmem_phys_lo` and `shmem_phys_hi` are all-ones bitwise, the SBI
implementation will stop reporting steal-time information for the virtual hart.

The `flags` parameter is reserved for future use and MUST be zero.

It is not expected for the shared memory to be written by the supervisor-mode
software while it is in use for steal-time accounting. However, the SBI
implementation MUST not misbehave if a write from supervisor-mode software
occurs, however, in that case, it MAY leave the shared memory filled with
inconsistent data.

The SBI implementation MUST stop writing to the shared memory when the
supervisor-mode software is not runnable, such as upon system reset or system
suspend.

NOTE: Not writing to the shared memory when the supervisor-mode software is
not runnable avoids unnecessary work and supports repeatable capture of a
system image while the supervisor-mode software is suspended.

The shared memory layout is defined in <<table_sta_shmem_structure>>

| sequence  | 0      | 4    | The SBI implementation MUST increment this field
                              to an odd value before writing the `steal` field,
                              and increment it again to an even value after
                              writing `steal` (i.e. an odd sequence number
                              indicates an in-progress update). The SBI
                              implementation SHOULD ensure that the sequence
                              field remains odd for only very short periods of
                              time. +

                              not be reported as steal-time.

                              preempted (i.e. while the `steal` field is
                              increasing), while a zero value MUST be written
