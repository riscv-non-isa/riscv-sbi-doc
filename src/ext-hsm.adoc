== Hart State Management Extension (EID #0x48534D "HSM")

The Hart State Management (HSM) Extension introduces a set of hart states and a
set of functions which allow the supervisor-mode software to request a hart
state change.

The <<table_hsm_states>> shown below describes all possible **HSM states**
along with a unique **HSM state id** for each state:

[cols="1,2,4", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| State ID | State Name      | Description
| 0        | STARTED         | The hart is physically powered-up and executing
                               normally.
| 1        | STOPPED         | The hart is not executing in supervisor-mode
                               or any lower privilege mode. It is probably
                               powered-down by the SBI implementation if the
                               underlying platform has a mechanism to
                               physically power-down harts.
| 2        | START_PENDING   | Some other hart has requested to start (or
                               power-up) the hart from the **STOPPED** state
                               and the SBI implementation is still working to
                               get the hart in the **STARTED** state.
| 3        | STOP_PENDING    | The hart has requested to stop (or power-down)
                               itself from the **STARTED** state and the SBI
                               implementation is still working to get the hart
                               in the **STOPPED** state.
| 4        | SUSPENDED       | This hart is in a platform specific suspend
                               (or low power) state.
| 5        | SUSPEND_PENDING | The hart has requested to put itself in a
                               platform specific low power state from the
                               **STARTED** state and the SBI implementation
                               is still working to get the hart in the
                               platform specific **SUSPENDED** state.
| 6        | RESUME_PENDING  | An interrupt or platform specific hardware
                               event has caused the hart to resume normal
                               execution from the **SUSPENDED** state and
                               the SBI implementation is still working to
                               get the hart in the **STARTED** state.
|===

At any point in time, a hart should be in one of the above mentioned hart
states. The hart state transitions by the SBI implementation should follow
the state machine shown below in the <<figure_hsm>>.

[#figure_hsm]
.SBI HSM State Machine
image::images/riscv-sbi-hsm.png[]

A platform can have multiple harts grouped into hierarchical topology
groups (namely cores, clusters, nodes, etc.) with separate platform specific
low-power states for each hierarchical group. These platform specific
low-power states of hierarchical topology groups can be represented as
platform specific suspend states of a hart. An SBI implementation can
utilize the suspend states of higher topology groups using one of the
following approaches:

. *Platform-coordinated:* In this approach, when a hart becomes idle the
  supervisor-mode power-managment software will request deepest suspend
  state for the hart and higher topology groups. An SBI implementation
  should choose a suspend state at higher topology group which is:
.. Not deeper than the specified suspend state
.. Wake-up latency is not higher than the wake-up latency of the
   specified suspend state
. *OS-inititated:* In this approach, the supervisor-mode power-managment
  software will directly request a suspend state for higher topology group
  after the last hart in that group becomes idle. When a hart becomes idle,
  the supervisor-mode power-managment software will always select suspend
  state for the hart itself but it will select a suspend state for a higher
  topology group only if the hart is the last running hart in the group.
  An SBI implementation should:
.. Never choose a suspend state for higher topology group different from
   the specified suspend state
.. Always prefer most recent suspend state requested for higher topology
   group

=== Function: Hart start (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_start(unsigned long hartid,
                             unsigned long start_addr,
                             unsigned long opaque)
----

Request the SBI implementation to start executing the target hart in
supervisor-mode, at the address specified by `start_addr`, with the
specific register values described in <<table_hsm_hart_start_regs>>.

[#table_hsm_hart_start_regs]
.HSM Hart Start Register State
[cols=",", width=80%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
|Register Name | Register Value
|satp          | 0
|sstatus.SIE   | 0
|a0            | hartid
|a1            | `opaque` parameter
2+|All other registers remain in an undefined state.
|===

NOTE: A single `unsigned long` parameter is sufficient as `start_addr`,
because the hart will start execution in supervisor-mode with the MMU off,
hence `start_addr` must be less than XLEN bits wide.

This call is asynchronous -- more specifically, the `sbi_hart_start()` may
return before the target hart starts executing as long as the SBI implementation
is capable of ensuring the return code is accurate.
If the SBI implementation is a platform runtime firmware executing in
machine-mode (M-mode), then it MUST configure any physical memory protection
it supports, such as that defined by PMP, and other M-mode state, before
transferring control to supervisor-mode software.

The `hartid` parameter specifies the target hart which is to be started.

The `start_addr` parameter points to a runtime-specified physical address,
where the hart can start executing in supervisor-mode.

The `opaque` parameter is an XLEN-bit value which will be set in the `a1`
register when the hart starts executing at `start_addr`.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
<<table_hsm_hart_start_errors>> below.

                              start executing from `start_addr`.
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS   | `start_addr` is not valid, possibly due to the
                              following reasons: +
                              * It is not a valid physical address. +
                              * Executable access to the address is prohibited
                                by a physical memory protection mechanism or

| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM     | `hartid` is not a valid hartid as the
                              corresponding hart cannot be started in supervisor
                              mode.
| SBI_ERR_ALREADY_AVAILABLE | The given hartid is already started.

=== Function: Hart stop (FID #1)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_stop(void)
----

Request the SBI implementation to stop executing the calling hart in
supervisor-mode and return its ownership to the SBI implementation.
This call is not expected to return under normal conditions. The
`sbi_hart_stop()` must be called with supervisor-mode interrupts disabled.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
<<table_hsm_hart_stop_errors>> below.

=== Function: Hart get status (FID #2)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_get_status(unsigned long hartid)
----

Get the current status (or HSM state id) of the given hart in `sbiret.value`,
or an error through `sbiret.error`.

The `hartid` parameter specifies the target hart for which status is
required.

The possible status (or HSM state id) values returned in `sbiret.value`
are described in <<table_hsm_states>>.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
<<table_hsm_hart_get_status_errors>> below.

|===

The harts may transition HSM states at any time due to any concurrent
`sbi_hart_start()` or `sbi_hart_stop()` or `sbi_hart_suspend()` calls,
the return value from this function may not represent the actual state
of the hart at the time of return value verification.

=== Function: Hart suspend (FID #3)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_suspend(uint32_t suspend_type,
                               unsigned long resume_addr,
                               unsigned long opaque)
----

Request the SBI implementation to put the calling hart in a platform specific
suspend (or low power) state specified by the `suspend_type` parameter. The
hart will automatically come out of suspended state and resume normal
execution when it receives an interrupt or platform specific hardware event.

The platform specific suspend states for a hart can be either retentive
or non-retentive in nature. A retentive suspend state will preserve hart
register and CSR values for all privilege modes whereas a non-retentive
suspend state will not preserve hart register and CSR values.

Resuming from a retentive suspend state is straight forward and the
supervisor-mode software will see SBI suspend call return without any
failures.  The `resume_addr` parameter is unused during retentive suspend.

Resuming from a non-retentive suspend state is relatively more involved and
requires software to restore various hart registers and CSRs for all privilege
modes. Upon resuming from non-retentive suspend state, the hart will jump to
supervisor-mode at address specified by `resume_addr` with specific registers
values described in the <<table_hsm_hart_resume_regs>> below.

[#table_hsm_hart_resume_regs]
.HSM Hart Resume Register State

|a1            | `opaque` parameter
2+|All other registers remain in an undefined state.
|===

NOTE: A single `unsigned long` parameter is sufficient for `resume_addr`,
because the hart will resume execution in supervisor-mode with the MMU off,
hence `resume_addr` must be less than XLEN bits wide.

The `suspend_type` parameter is 32 bits wide and the possible values are
shown in <<table_hsm_hart_suspend_types>> below.

| 0x00000000              | Default retentive suspend
| 0x00000001 - 0x0FFFFFFF | Reserved for future use
| 0x10000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF | Platform specific retentive suspend
| 0x80000000              | Default non-retentive suspend
| 0x80000001 - 0x8FFFFFFF | Reserved for future use
| 0x90000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF | Platform specific non-retentive suspend
|===

The `resume_addr` parameter points to a runtime-specified physical address,
where the hart can resume execution in supervisor-mode after a non-retentive
suspend.

The `opaque` parameter is an XLEN-bit value which will be set in the `a1`
register when the hart resumes execution at `resume_addr` after a
non-retentive suspend.

                            from a retentive suspend state.
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM   | `suspend_type` is reserved or is platform-specific
                            and unimplemented.
| SBI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED   | `suspend_type` is not reserved and is implemented,
                            but the platform does not support it due to one
                            or more missing dependencies.
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS | `resume_addr` is not valid, possibly due to the
                            following reasons: +

                              by a physical memory protection mechanism or
                              H-extension G-stage for supervisor-mode.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED          | The suspend request failed for unspecified or
