## Introduction

This specification describes the RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface, known from
here on as SBI.  This interface allows supervisor-mode software to be written
that is portable to all RISC-V implementations.  The design of the SBI follows
the general RISC-V philosophy of having a small core along with a set of
optional modular extensions.

### Versioning and History

This document describes a draft of version 0.2 of the RISC-V SBI specification.

#### Changes Since Version 0.1

* The entire v0.1 SBI has been moved to the legacy extension, which is now an
  optional extension.  This is technically a backwards-incompatible change
  because the legacy extension is optional and v0.1 of the SBI doesn't allow
  probing, but it's as good as we can do.

## Binary Encoding

All SBI functions share a single binary encoding, which facilitates the mixing
of SBI extensions.  This binary encoding matches the standard RISC-V UNIX
syscall ABI, which itself is based on the calling convention defined in the
RISC-V ELF psABI.  In other words, SBI calls are exactly the same as standard
RISC-V function calls except that:

* An `ecall` is used as the control transfer instruction instead of a `call`
  instruction.
* `a7` (or `t0` on RV32E-based systems) encodes the SBI extension ID, which
  matches how the system call ID is encoded in the standard UNIX system call
  ABI.

Many SBI extensions also chose to encode an additional function ID in `a6`,
a scheme similar to the `ioctl()` system call on many UNIX operating systems.
This allows SBI extensions to encode multiple functions within the space of a
single extension.

In the name of compatibility, SBI extension IDs and SBI function IDs are
encoded as signed 32-bit integers.  When passed in registers these follow the
standard RISC-V calling convention rules.

SBI functions generally return a pair of values in `a0` and `a1`, with `a1`
returning an error code.  This is analogous to returning the C structure

    struct sbiret {
        long value;
        long error;
    };

Standard SBI error codes are listed below

| Error Type               | Value  |
|:------------------------:|:------:|
|  SBI_SUCCESS             |  0     |
|  SBI_ERR_FAILURE         | -1     |
|  SBI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED   | -2     |
|  SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM   | -3     |
|  SBI_ERR_DENIED          | -4     |
|  SBI_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS | -5     |


## SBI Base Functionality, Extension ID 0x10

The base of the supervisor binary interface is designed to be as small as
possible.  As such, it only contains functionality for probing which SBI
extensions are available and for querying the version of the SBI.  All
functions in the base must be supported by all SBI implementations, so there
are no error returns defined.

```
long sbi_get_sbi_spec_version(void);
```
Returns the current SBI specification version.  This function must always
succeed.  The minor number of the SBI specification is encoded in the low 24
bits, with the major number encoded in the next 7 bits.  Bit 32 must be 0 and
is reserved for future expansion.

```
long sbi_get_sbi_impl_id(void);
```
Returns the current SBI implementation ID, which is different for every SBI
implementation.  It is intended that this implementation ID allows software to
probe for SBI implementation quirks.

````
long sbi_get_sbi_impl_version(void);
````
Returns the current SBI implementation version.  The encoding of this version
number is specific to the SBI implementation.

````
long sbi_probe_extension(long extension_id);
````
Returns 0 if the given extension ID is not available, or an extension-specific
non-zero value if it is available.

````
long sbi_get_mvendorid(void);
long sbi_get_marchid(void);
long sbi_get_mimpid(void);
````
Returns a value that is legal for the corresponding CSR.  0 is always a legal
value for any of these CSRs.

## Legacy SBI Extension, Extension IDs 0x00 through 0x0F

The legacy SBI ignores the function ID field, instead being encoded as multiple
extension IDs.  Each of these extension IDs must be probed for directly.  This
extension is deprecated in favor of the following extensions:

```C
void sbi_set_timer(uint64_t stime_value)
```
Programs the clock for next event after *stime_value* time. This function also
clears the pending timer interrupt bit.

If the supervisor wishes to clear the timer interrupt without scheduling the next
timer event, it can either request a timer interrupt infinitely far into the
future (i.e., (uint64_t)-1), or it can instead mask the timer interrupt by
clearing sie.STIE.

```C
void sbi_send_ipi(const unsigned long *hart_mask)
```
Send an inter-processor interrupt to all the harts defined in hart_mask.
Interprocessor interrupts manifest at the receiving harts as Supervisor Software
Interrupts.

hart_mask is a physical address that points to a bit-vector of harts. The bit
vector is represented as a sequence of unsigned longs whose length equals the
number of harts in the system divided by the number of bits in an unsigned long,
rounded up to the next integer.

```C
void sbi_clear_ipi(void)
```
Clears the pending IPIs if any. The IPI is cleared only in the hart for which
this SBI call is invoked.

```C
void sbi_remote_fence_i(const unsigned long *hart_mask)
```
Instruct remote harts to execute FENCE.I instruction.
N.B. hart_mask is as described in sbi_send_ipi.

```C
void sbi_remote_sfence_vma(const unsigned long *hart_mask,
                           unsigned long start,
                           unsigned long size)
```
Instruct the remote harts to execute one or more SFENCE.VMA instructions,
covering the range of virtual addresses between start and size.

```C
void sbi_remote_sfence_vma_asid(const unsigned long *hart_mask,
                                unsigned long start,
                                unsigned long size,
                                unsigned long asid)
```
Instruct the remote harts to execute one or more SFENCE.VMA instructions,
covering the range of virtual addresses between start and size.  This covers
only the given ASID.

```C
int sbi_console_getchar(void)
```
Read a byte from debug console; returns the byte on success, or -1 for failure.
Note. This is the only SBI call that has a non-void return type.

```C
void sbi_console_putchar(int ch)
```
Write data present in *ch* to debug console.

Unlike `sbi_console_getchar`, this SBI call **will block** if there
remain any pending characters to be transmitted or if the receiving terminal
is not yet ready to receive the byte. However, if the console doesn't exist
at all, then the character is thrown away.

```C
void sbi_shutdown(void)
```
Puts all the harts to shut down state from supervisor point of view. This SBI
call doesn't return.
