== Change Log

=== Version 0.3-rc0

* Improved document styling and naming conventions
* Added SBI system reset extension
* Improved SBI introduction secion
* Improved documentation of SBI hart state managment extension

=== Version 0.2

* The entire v0.1 SBI has been moved to the legacy extension, which is now
  an optional extension. This is technically a backwards-incompatible change
  because the legacy extension is optional and v0.1 of the SBI doesn't allow
  probing, but it's as good as we can do.

== Introduction

This specification describes the RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface, known
from here on as SBI. The SBI allows supervisor-mode (S-mode or VS-mode)
software to be portable across all RISC-V implementations by defining an
abstraction for platform (or hypervisor) specific functionality. The design
of the SBI follows the general RISC-V philosophy of having a small core along
with a set of optional modular extensions.

The higher privilege software providing SBI interface to the supervisor-mode
software is referred to as a SBI implemenation or Supervisor Execution
Environment (SEE). A SBI implementation (or SEE) can be platform runtime
firmware executing in machine-mode (M-mode) (see below <<fig_intro1>>) or
it can be some hypervisor executing in hypervisor-mode (HS-mode) (see below
<<fig_intro2>>).

== Binary Encoding

All SBI functions share a single binary encoding, which facilitates the mixing
of SBI extensions. This binary encoding matches the RISC-V Linux syscall ABI,
which itself is based on the calling convention defined in the RISC-V ELF
psABI. In other words, SBI calls are exactly the same as standard RISC-V
function calls except that:

* An `ECALL` is used as the control transfer instruction instead of a `CALL`
  instruction.
* `a7` (or `t0` on RV32E-based systems) encodes the SBI extension ID (*EID*),
  which matches how the system call ID is encoded in Linux system call ABI.

Many SBI extensions also chose to encode an additional SBI function ID (*FID*)
in `a6`, a scheme similar to the `ioctl()` system call on many UNIX operating
systems. This allows SBI extensions to encode multiple functions within the
space of a single extension.

In the name of compatibility, SBI extension IDs (*EIDs*) and SBI function IDs
(*FIDs*) are encoded as signed 32-bit integers. When passed in registers these
follow the standard RISC-V calling convention rules.

SBI functions must return a pair of values in `a0` and `a1`, with `a0`
returning an error code. This is analogous to returning the C structure

[source, C]
----
    struct sbiret {
        long error;
        long value;
    };
----

Standard SBI error codes are listed below

[cols="2,1", width=50%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
|  Error Type                |Value
|  SBI_SUCCESS               |  0
|  SBI_ERR_FAILED            | -1
|  SBI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED     | -2
|  SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM     | -3
|  SBI_ERR_DENIED            | -4
|  SBI_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS   | -5
|  SBI_ERR_ALREADY_AVAILABLE | -6
|===

Every SBI function should prefer `unsigned long` as the data type. It keeps
the specification simple and easily adaptable for all RISC-V ISA types (i.e.
RV32, RV64 and RV128). In case the data is defined as 32bit wide, higher
privilege software must ensure that it only uses 32 bit data only.

If a SBI function needs to pass a list of harts to the higher privilege mode,
it must use a hart mask as defined below. This is applicable to any extensions
defined in or after v0.2.

Any function, requiring a hart mask, need to pass following two arguments.

* `unsigned long hart_mask` is a scalar bit-vector containing hartids
* `unsigned long hart_mask_base` is the starting hartid from which bit-vector
   must be computed.

In a single SBI function call, maximum number harts that can be set is
always XLEN. If a lower privilege mode needs to pass information about more
than XLEN harts, it should invoke multiple instances of the SBI function
call. `hart_mask_base` can be set to `-1` to indicate that `hart_mask` can
be ignored and all available harts must be considered.

Any function using hart mask may return following possible error value in
addition to function specific error values.

|===
| Error code            | Description
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM | Either `hart_mask_base` or any of the hartid from
                          `hart_mask` is not valid i.e. either the hartid is
                           not enabled by the platform or is not available to
                          the supervisor.

== Base Extension (EID #0x10)

The base extension is designed to be as small as possible. As such, it only
contains functionality for probing which SBI extensions are available and for
querying the version of the SBI. All functions in the base extension must be
supported by all SBI implementations, so there are no error returns defined.

=== Function: Get SBI specification version (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_spec_version(void);
----

Returns the current SBI specification version. This function must always
succeed. The minor number of the SBI specification is encoded in the low 24
bits, with the major number encoded in the next 7 bits. Bit 31 must be 0 and
is reserved for future expansion.

=== Function: Get SBI implementation ID (FID #1)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_impl_id(void);
----

Returns the current SBI implementation ID, which is different for every SBI
implementation. It is intended that this implementation ID allows software to
probe for SBI implementation quirks.

=== Function: Get SBI implementation version (FID #2)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_impl_version(void);
----

Returns the current SBI implementation version. The encoding of this version
number is specific to the SBI implementation.

=== Function: Probe SBI extension (FID #3)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_probe_extension(long extension_id);
----

Returns 0 if the given SBI extension ID (*EID*) is not available, or an
extension-specific non-zero value if it is available.

=== Function: Get machine vendor ID (FID #4)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_mvendorid(void);
----

Return a value that is legal for the `mvendorid` CSR and 0 is always a legal
value for this CSR.

=== Function: Get machine architecture ID (FID #5)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_marchid(void);
----

Return a value that is legal for the `marchid` CSR and 0 is always a legal
value for this CSR.

=== Function: Get machine implementation ID (FID #6)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_get_mimpid(void);
----

Return a value that is legal for the `mimpid` CSR and 0 is always a legal
value for this CSR.

== Legacy Extensions (EIDs #0x00 - #0x0F)

The legacy SBI extensions ignores the SBI function ID field, instead being
encoded as multiple SBI extension IDs. Each of these extension IDs must be
probed for directly.

The legacy SBI extensions is deprecated in favor of the other extensions
listed below. The legacy console SBI functions (`sbi_console_getchar()`
and `sbi_console_putchar()`) are expected to be deprecated; they have
no replacement.

=== Extension: Set Timer (EID #0x00)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_set_timer(uint64_t stime_value)
----

Programs the clock for next event after *stime_value* time. This function
also clears the pending timer interrupt bit.

If the supervisor wishes to clear the timer interrupt without scheduling
the next timer event, it can either request a timer interrupt infinitely
far into the future (i.e., (uint64_t)-1), or it can instead mask the timer
interrupt by clearing `sie.STIE` CSR bit.

=== Extension: Console Putchar (EID #0x01)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_console_putchar(int ch)
----

Write data present in *ch* to debug console.

Unlike `sbi_console_getchar()`, this SBI call **will block** if there remain
any pending characters to be transmitted or if the receiving terminal is not
yet ready to receive the byte. However, if the console doesn't exist at all,
then the character is thrown away.

=== Extension: Console Getchar (EID #0x02)

[source, C]
----
int sbi_console_getchar(void)
----

Read a byte from debug console; returns the byte on success, or -1 for
failure. Note. This is the only SBI call in the legacy extension that has
a non-void return type.

=== Extension: Clear IPI (EID #0x03)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_clear_ipi(void)
----

Clears the pending IPIs if any. The IPI is cleared only in the hart for
which this SBI call is invoked. `sbi_clear_ipi()` is deprecated because
S-mode code can clear `sip.SSIP` CSR bit directly.

=== Extension: Send IPI (EID #0x04)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_send_ipi(const unsigned long *hart_mask)
----

Send an inter-processor interrupt to all the harts defined in hart_mask.
Interprocessor interrupts manifest at the receiving harts as Supervisor
Software Interrupts.

hart_mask is a virtual address that points to a bit-vector of harts. The
bit vector is represented as a sequence of unsigned longs whose length
equals the number of harts in the system divided by the number of bits
in an unsigned long, rounded up to the next integer.

=== Extension: Remote FENCE.I (EID #0x05)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_remote_fence_i(const unsigned long *hart_mask)
----

Instructs remote harts to execute `FENCE.I` instruction. The `hart_mask`
is same as described in `sbi_send_ipi()`.

=== Extension: Remote SFENCE.VMA (EID #0x06)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_remote_sfence_vma(const unsigned long *hart_mask,
                           unsigned long start,
                           unsigned long size)
----

Instructs the remote harts to execute one or more `SFENCE.VMA` instructions,
covering the range of virtual addresses between start and size.

=== Extension: Remote SFENCE.VMA with ASID (EID #0x07)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_remote_sfence_vma_asid(const unsigned long *hart_mask,
                                unsigned long start,
                                unsigned long size,
                                unsigned long asid)
----

Instruct the remote harts to execute one or more `SFENCE.VMA` instructions,
covering the range of virtual addresses between start and size. This covers
only the given `ASID`.

=== Extension: System Shutdown (EID #0x08)

[source, C]
----
void sbi_shutdown(void)
----

Puts all the harts to shutdown state from supervisor point of view. This SBI
call doesn't return.

== Timer Extension (EID #0x54494D45 "TIME")

This replaces legacy timer extension (EID #0x00). It follows the new calling
convention defined in v0.2.

=== Function: Set Timer (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_set_timer(uint64_t stime_value)
----

Programs the clock for next event after *stime_value* time. *stime_value*
is in absolute time. This function must clear the pending timer interrupt
bit as well.

If the supervisor wishes to clear the timer interrupt without scheduling
the next timer event, it can either request a timer interrupt infinitely
far into the future (i.e., (uint64_t)-1), or it can instead mask the timer
interrupt by clearing `sie.STIE` CSR bit.

== IPI Extension (EID #0x735049 "sPI: s-mode IPI")

This extension replaces the legacy extension (EID #0x04). The other IPI related
legacy extension(0x3) is deprecated now. All the functions in this extension
follow the `hart_mask` as defined in the binary encoding section.

=== Function: Send IPI (FID #0)

----
struct sbiret sbi_send_ipi(unsigned long hart_mask,
                           unsigned long hart_mask_base)

== RFENCE Extension (EID #0x52464E43 "RFNC")

This extension defines all remote fence related functions and replaces
the legacy extensions (EIDs #0x05 - #0x07). All the functions follow the
`hart_mask` as defined in binary encoding section. Any function wishes
to use range of addresses (i.e. start_addr and size), have to abide by
the below constraints on range parameters.

The remote fence function acts as a full TLB flush if

* `start_addr` and `size` are both 0
* `size` is equal to 2^XLEN-1

== Hart State Management Extension (EID #0x48534D "HSM")

The Hart State Management (HSM) Extension introduces a set hart states and a
set of functions which allow the supervisor-mode software to request a hart
state change.

The possible hart states are as follows:

* **STOPPED:** The hart is not executing in supervisor-mode or any lower
  privilege mode. It is probably powered-down by the SBI implementation
  if the underlying platform has a mechanism to physically power-down harts.
* **STARTED:** The hart is physically powered-up and executing normally.
* **START_PENDING:** Some other hart has requested to start (or power-up)
  the hart from the **STOPPED** state and the SBI implementation is still
  working to get the hart in the **STARTED** state.
* **STOP_PENDING:** The hart has requested to stop (or power-down) itself
  from the **STARTED** state and the SBI implementation is still working
  to get the hart in the **STOPPED** state.

At any point in time, a hart should be in one of the above mentioned hart
states. The hart state transitions by the SBI implementation should follow
the state machine shown below in the figure <<fig_hsm>>.

=== Function: HART start (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_start(unsigned long hartid,
                             unsigned long start_addr,
                             unsigned long opaque)
----

Request the SBI implementation to start executing the given hart at specified
address in supervisor-mode. This call is asynchronous -- more specifically,
the `sbi_hart_start()` may return before target hart starts executing as long
as the SBI implemenation is capable of ensuring the return code is accurate.
It is recommended that if the SBI implementation is a platform runtime
firmware executing in machine-mode (M-mode) then it MUST configure PMP and
other the M-mode state before executing in supervisor-mode.

The `hartid` parameter specifies the target hart which is to be started.

The `start_addr` parameter points to a runtime-specified physical address,
where the hart can start executing in supervisor-mode.

The `opaque` parameter is a XLEN-bit value which will be set in the `a1`
register when the hart starts executing at `start_addr`.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
table below:

[cols="1,2", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Error code                | Description
| SBI_SUCCESS               | Hart was previously in stopped state. It will
                              start executing from `start_addr`.
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS   | `start_addr` is not valid possibly due to
                              following reasons: +
                              * It is not a valid physical address. +
                              * The address is prohibited by PMP to run in
                                supervisor mode.
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM     | `hartid` is not a valid hartid as corresponding
                              hart cannot started in supervisor mode.
| SBI_ERR_ALREADY_AVAILABLE | The given hartid is already started.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED            | The start request failed for unknown reasons.
|===

The target hart jumps to supervisor-mode at address specified by `start_addr`
with following values in specific registers.

[cols=",", width=50%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
|Register Name | Register Value
|satp          | 0
|sstatus.SIE   | 0
|a0            | hartid
|a1            | opaque
|===

All other registers remain in an undefined state.

=== Function: HART stop (FID #1)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_stop(void)
----

Request the SBI implementation to stop executing the calling hart in
supervisor-mode and return it's ownership to the SBI implementation.
This call is not expected to return under normal conditions. The
`sbi_hart_stop()` must be called with the supervisor-mode interrupts
disabled.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
table below:

[cols="1,2", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Error code     | Description
| SBI_ERR_FAILED | Failed to stop execution of the current hart
|===

=== Function: HART get status (FID #2)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_hart_get_status(unsigned long hartid)
----

Get the current status (or HSM state) of the given hart in `sbiret.value`,
or an error through `sbiret.error`.

The `hartid` parameter specifies the target hart which is to be started.

The possible status values returned in `sbiret.value` are shown in the
table below:

[cols="2,1,2", width=80%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Name          | Value | Description
| STARTED       |   0   | Hart Started
| STOPPED       |   1   | Hart Stopped
| START_PENDING |   2   | Hart start request pending
| STOP_PENDING  |   3   | Hart stop request pending
|===

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown in the
table below:

[cols="1,2", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Error code            | Description
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM | The given `hartid` or `start_addr` is not valid
|===

The harts may transition HSM states at any time due to any concurrent
`sbi_hart_start` or `sbi_hart_stop` calls, the return value from this
function may not represent the actual state of the hart at the time of
return value verification.

== System Reset Extension (EID #0x53525354 "SRST")

The System Reset Extension provides a function that allow the supervisor
software to request system-level reboot or shutdown. The term "system"
refers to the world-view of supervisor software and the underlying SBI
implementation could be machine mode firmware or hypervisor.

=== Function: System reset (FID #0)

[source, C]
----
struct sbiret sbi_system_reset(unsigned long reset_type,
                               unsigned long reset_reason)
----

Reset the system based on provided `reset_type` and `reset_reason`. This is
a synchronous call and does not return if it succeeds.

The `reset_type` parameter is 32 bits wide and has the following possible
values:

[cols="1,2", width=90%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Value                   | Description
| 0x00000000              | Shutdown
| 0x00000001              | Cold reboot
| 0x00000002              | Warm reboot
| 0x00000003 - 0xEFFFFFFF | Reserved for future use
| 0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF | Vendor or platform specific reset type
| > 0xFFFFFFFF            | Reserved (and non-existent on RV32)
|===

The `reset_reason` is an optional parameter representing the reason for
system reset. This parameter is 32 bits wide and has the following possible
values:

[cols="1,2", width=90%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Value                   | Description
| 0x00000000              | No reason
| 0x00000001              | System failure
| 0x00000002 - 0xDFFFFFFF | Reserved for future use
| 0xE0000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF | SBI implementation specific reset reason
| 0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF | Vendor or platform specific reset reason
| > 0xFFFFFFFF            | Reserved (and non-existent on RV32)
|===

When supervisor software is running natively, the SBI implementation is
machine mode firmware. In this case, shutdown is equivalent to physical
power down of the entire system and cold reboot is equivalent to physical
power cycle of the entire system. Further, warm reboot is equivalent to
a power cycle of main processor and parts of the system but not the entire
system. For example, on a server class system with a BMC (board management
controller), a warm reboot will not power cycle the BMC whereas a cold
reboot will definitely power cycle the BMC.

When supervisor software is running inside a virtual machine, the SBI
implementation is a hypervisor. The shutdown, cold reboot and warm reboot
will behave functionally the same as the native case but might not result
in any physical power changes.

*Returns* one of the following possible SBI error codes through sbiret.error
upon failure.

[cols="1,2", width=90%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Error code            | Description
| SBI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM | `reset_type` or `reset_reason` is not valid.
| SBI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED | `reset_type` is valid but not implemented.
| SBI_ERR_FAILED        | Reset request failed for unknown reasons.
